# Graph Applications

C++ implementation from scratch of key Graph data structures (Matrix, Adj. List for both weighted and unweighted) and algorithms (BFS, DFS, Prim, Djikstra)

The theoretical proposal for this project was done during the Graph Theory class at UFRJ. All of the OOP design of the classes was our own.
